## An Overview of Chef InSpec

Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for writing and executing infrastructure tests. It allows users to define compliance, security, and policy tests as code. Chef InSpec ensures that your infrastructure adheres to the security, compliance, and configuration policies you've established. It supports various platforms and integrates seamlessly with the Chef ecosystem to automate compliance testing across the infrastructure.

Chef InSpec can be used to:

- Checking the security of your systems.
- Ensure that infrastructure remains compliant with industry standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
- Automate the testing of system configurations.

## How does Chef InSpec work?

Chef InSpec works by executing compliance and security checks written as human-readable tests. These tests are written using InSpec profiles, which contain a collection of tests and can be customized to match specific organizational policies.

The workflow generally involves:

1. **Write Tests as Code**: Define the desired compliance or configuration state in the form of InSpec profiles and controls.
2. **Execute Tests**: Run InSpec on your infrastructure using a target mode to check whether the systems conform to the specified policies.
3. **Report Results**: Chef InSpec provides detailed reports highlighting any failed tests, allowing you to quickly remediate any compliance issues.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: With integration into Chef Automate, you can continuously monitor your infrastructure's compliance status.


## Use cases

Chef InSpec is commonly used in several scenarios:

- Compliance Auditing: Automate the validation of your infrastructure against security standards like CIS, NIST, or PCI-DSS.
- Security Testing: Ensure your systems are configured securely with automated security checks.
- Policy Enforcement: Maintain consistency across your infrastructure by defining baseline configurations and ensuring they are followed.
- DevSecOps: Integrate compliance and security checks into your CI/CD pipeline, allowing for early detection and remediation of configuration drift.

## Supported Platforms

Chef InSpec is supported on the following operating systems and platforms:

### Derived Platforms

| Platform         | Architecture    | Version | Parent Platform |
|------------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| **AlmaLinux**    | x86_64, aarch64 | 8.x     | CentOS          |
| **Rocky Linux**  | x86_64, aarch64 | 8.x     | CentOS          |

**Note:** Chef InSpec may function on additional platforms, versions, and architectures in **Target Mode** (`inspec --target`), but they are not officially validated by Chef.


## Install

Because Chef InSpec is already included as part of the Chef Workstation package. If you have Chef Workstation installed, you already have Chef InSpec available for use.

Verify that Chef InSpec is available:
```
inspec --version
```
the output:
```
Chef InSpec version: 5.22.40
```

You should see the installed version of Chef InSpec.

## How to use Chef Inspec

Using Chef InSpec involves writing and running compliance profiles on your systems. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Create an InSpec Profile

Create a new InSpec profile using the ``inspec`` command:
```
inspec init profile my-profile
```

### Step 2: Write InSpec Control

### Step 3: Running InSpec on a Local Machine

### Step 4: Running InSpec on a Remote Target
